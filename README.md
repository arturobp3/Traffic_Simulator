* [Executable file](https://github.com/arturobp3/Traffic_Simulator/blob/master/Traffic%20Simulator.jar)
* [Code](https://github.com/arturobp3/Traffic_Simulator/tree/master/Codigo/src)

# Steps to use the application:

* Load an event file in the simulator (On the menu bar: Ficheros > Cargar Eventos). You can find those events [here](https://github.com/arturobp3/Traffic_Simulator/tree/master/Archivos%20para%20ejecutar)

* Now, insert the previously loaded events in the simulator (Simulador > Insertar evento). I recommend using the file called "cruces_2.ini", since you will be able to execute more simulation steps.

* Choose a delay. If you choose 1000, it will take 1 second to execute and you will be able to see everything more clearly.

* Choose the steps you want to execute.

* Press the play button and enjoy!
